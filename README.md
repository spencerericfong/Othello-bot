# Othello-bot
 Simple Othello bot coded in C++. Came in 7th place out of 400 in a class-wide tournament between other Othello bots!

 The bot is coded utilizing a recursive min-max algorithm that does a depth first search on the game's *game tree*, which is a search tree of all possible game states to a depth of 3 moves into the future.
